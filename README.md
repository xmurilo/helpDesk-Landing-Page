# Landing Page - Help Desk ‚öôÔ∏è
## About the project üìí

<p>In this project, I developed a landing page for a Help Desk as part of a challenge proposed by my Web Development teacher. The goal was to demonstrate the knowledge acquired throughout the semester.</p>
  <h2>What I learned? üå±</h2> 
 <ul>
  <p>With this project, I was able to further expand my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br> Some of the main learnings were:</p>
  
<li>Creation of a hamburger menu using only CSS, without the need for JavaScript.</li>
<li>Manipulation of the placeholder of an input field using CSS.</li>
<li>Application of JavaScript in a carousel, adding dynamism to the project.</li>
<li>Form validation.</li>
<li>Improvement of design skills, exploring different techniques and resources.</li>

 </ul>

</li>
  <li>Mobile First: Apply the concept of Mobile First to ensure an optimized experience on mobile devices.
</li>
</ul>

<p>I am excited to continue improving my skills and knowledge in the programming field. If you have any suggestions or ideas for future projects, feel free to share!</p>
